The druglogics-synergy module runs sequentially two software modules. Firstly, gitsbe is used to create an ensemble of Boolean models fit to a specific steady state or perturbation data using a genetic parameterization algorithm. Then drabme uses the output models from gitsbe to perform a drug response analysis of a given drug panel and produces predicted synergy scores for each respective drug combination. You can find the full documentation for these two modules in the following link: https://druglogics.github.io/druglogics-doc/. Install Firstly, make sure you have installed Maven 3.6.0 and Java 8 (minimum working versions). For the rest of the tutorial we are going to use the druglogics-synergy at version 1.2.1, which includes gitsbe at 1.3.1 version and drabme at 1.2.1 version. There are two ways to install druglogics-synergy. The easiest option is to download the latest released package from GitHub: https://github.com/druglogics/druglogics-synergy/packages/. The file of interest is synergy-1.2.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar, which includes all dependencies and does not require any manual installation whatsoever. The other option is to clone the repositories1 and install them manually using Maven: git clone https://github.com/druglogics/gitsbe.git cd gitsbe git checkout v1.3.1 mvn clean install cd ../ git clone https://github.com/druglogics/drabme.git cd drabme git checkout v1.2.1 mvn clean install cd ../ git clone https://github.com/druglogics/druglogics-synergy cd druglogics-synergy git checkout v1.2.1 mvn clean install After executing the above commands, the synergy-1.2.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar file will be created inside the druglogics-synergy/target directory. Even if you choose the 1st option, make sure you clone the druglogics-synergy repo and put the synergy-1.2.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar file inside the druglogics-synergy/target directory (as mvn clean install command does) to be inline with the next instructions in this tutorial. Run CASCADE 1.0 Example We are going to use the ags_cascade_1.0 directory that resides in the druglogics-synergy directory as an input to the Launcher class to run the CASCADE 1.0 example. The command to execute from the root of the druglogics-synergy directory is the following: java -cp target/synergy-1.2.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar eu.druglogics.synergy.Launcher --inputDir=ags_cascade_1.0 The above command should create a new directory inside ags_cascade_1.0 that includes the output result files. Given that the simulations use all available cores, it shouldn’t take more than 30sec to 1min to complete the execution on a modern computer. For the rest of this tutorial we are going to use the output results produced from the execution of the above command, please refer to this directory. Inputs A brief description of the input files included in the ags_cascade_1.0 directory follows: network.sif: a single-interactions network file in Cytoscape’s .sif tab-delimited format. This file defines the CASCADE 1.0 topology. training: this file has the training data for gitsbe’s algorithm in one of the formats specified in the respective documentation. Here, we train to an unperturbed condition, with a steady state observation response as curated from many publications for the AGS cell line (Flobak et al. 2015). modeloutputs: this is a file that is used to calculate the output growth response of a Boolean model after its attractors are computed. See more information in the respective documentation. Here, we define 3 nodes that signal cell proliferation when active (RSK_f, MYC and TCF7_f) and 3 that signal apoptosis (CASP8, CASP9 and FOXO_f). drugpanel: this file has the drugs and their respective targets, which are going to be analyzed by drabme using gitsbe’s output Boolean models. More info can be found here. config: configuration file that defines several parameters used by gitsbe and drabme. Apart from the short description for each parameter provided in the config file, there is a more complete documentation of each option available here. The most important options for gitsbe are the tool used to calculate the models’ attractors (bioLQM, see (Naldi 2018)), the number of simulations \\((50)\\), number of generations per simulation (\\(20\\)), number of models per generation \\((20)\\), number of best-fit models to save after each simulation is finished \\((3)\\) and the type of model mutations used (here we use balance or link operator mutations). For drabme, the two most important configuration parameters are the maximum drug set size to test (\\(2\\), i.e. up to drug pairs) and the method used for the calculation of drug synergies (we use HSA (Gaddum 1940) in the config file, but also Bliss (Bliss 1939) is available). Outputs The most significant outputs in the results directory are: Gitsbe-specific: A models directory with files in .gitsbe format,2 representing the best-fit boolean models out of the simulations of the genetic algorithm. Here, since we configured to have \\(50\\) simulations and save the best \\(3\\) models out of each simulation, we end up with a total of \\(150\\) models after gitsbe finishes its execution. Drabme-specific: A ensemble-wise synergies file, providing the synergy predictions based on gitsbe’s models. For every drug combination tested (we have \\(7\\) drugs in the drugpanel file, so a total of \\({7\\choose2} = 21\\) drug pairs are tested), drabme calculates a synergy score indicating how synergistic that combination was (more negative means more synergistic), based on the HSA synergy metric. How are predictions calculated? Let’s look at an example: drabme has calculated a synergy score equal to \\(\\approx -0.943\\) for the combination PD-AK (MEK and AKT inhibitor). Drabme used gitsbe’s \\(150\\) output Boolean models and perturbed them first with the single drug PD (changing the equation of the respective target to equal \\(0\\), i.e. MEK_f = 0). Then it calculated all the models’ attractors. The ensemble of models that had at least one attractor were able to provide an output response each, from which drabme calculates the ensemble’s average response to the PD drug. Same procedure is followed for the AK drug: changing its target’s equation appropriately (AKT_f = 0) in all \\(150\\) models, calculating their attractors and using only the models that had at least one attractor to calculate the ensemble’s average response to drug PD. So we are left with two average single-drug response values, from which we choose as a reference value (according to the HSA model we used) the more negative of the two (as the values represent cell growth output). Drabme repeats the previous process by now changing both equations in all \\(150\\) models, computing their attractors and finding the ensemble’s average growth output response for the PD-AK combination. If this combination value is lower than the reference value, the difference is outputted in the ensemble synergies output file. For our particular case, the difference of the combination’s PK-AD average response to the minimum of the single-drug average responses in the \\(150\\) model ensemble, is equal to \\(\\approx -0.943\\). Since this value is the lowest in the output ensemble-wise synergies file, PK-AD is the most synergistic drug combination out of our simulations. Visualize Prediction Performance How good were our output synergy predictions? This is a standard binary classification problem (synergy or no synergy, varying a threshold defining how stringent is our definition of synergy) and to properly assess our algorithm’s performance we need to compare our results with a true set of drug synergies. All \\(21\\) drug combinations from the drugpanel file were experimentally tested in (Flobak et al. 2015), producing a set of \\(4\\) gold standard synergies: PI-PD, PI-5Z, PD-AK, AK-5Z Read Output Results Load the appropriate libraries: suppressMessages(library(dplyr)) library(tibble) library(emba) library(usefun) library(PRROC) library(DT) Read the data using the emba library (Zobolas, Kuiper, and Flobak 2020): # Read ensemble-wise synergies file # `ss` =&gt; models trained to steady state ss_hsa_file = &quot;ags_cascade_1.0_20211121_150114/ags_cascade_1.0_ensemblewise_synergies.tab&quot; ss_hsa_ensemblewise_synergies = emba::get_synergy_scores(ss_hsa_file) # Read observed synergies file observed_synergies_file = &#39;observed_synergies_cascade_1.0&#39; observed_synergies = emba::get_observed_synergies(observed_synergies_file) # 1 (positive/observed synergy) or 0 (negative/not observed) for all tested drug combinations observed = sapply(ss_hsa_ensemblewise_synergies$perturbation %in% observed_synergies, as.integer) # Make a data table pred_hsa = dplyr::bind_cols(ss_hsa_ensemblewise_synergies %&gt;% rename(ss_score = score), tibble::as_tibble_col(observed, column_name = &quot;observed&quot;)) # Visualize our prediction results in a table format DT::datatable(data = pred_hsa, options = list(pageLength = 7, lengthMenu = c(7, 14, 21), searching = FALSE)) %&gt;% DT::formatRound(columns = 2, digits = 3) Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) We use the get_roc_stats() function from the usefun R package (Zobolas 2020)): # Get ROC statistics (`res_ss_ew$AUC` holds the ROC AUC) res_ss_ew = usefun::get_roc_stats(df = pred_hsa, pred_col = &quot;ss_score&quot;, label_col = &quot;observed&quot;) # Plot ROC my_palette = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(n = 9, name = &quot;Set1&quot;) plot(x = res_ss_ew$roc_stats$FPR, y = res_ss_ew$roc_stats$TPR, type = &#39;l&#39;, lwd = 3, col = my_palette[1], main = &#39;ROC curve, Ensemble-wise synergies (HSA)&#39;, xlab = &#39;False Positive Rate (FPR)&#39;, ylab = &#39;True Positive Rate (TPR)&#39;) legend(&#39;bottomright&#39;, title = &#39;AUC&#39;, col = my_palette[1:2], pch = 19, legend = paste(round(res_ss_ew$AUC, digits = 2), &quot;Calibrated&quot;), cex = 1.3) grid(lwd = 0.5) abline(a = 0, b = 1, col = &#39;lightgrey&#39;, lty = &#39;dotdash&#39;, lwd = 1.2) Figure 1: ROC curve (CASCADE 1.0, HSA synergy method, 150 models calibrated to the AGS steady state) Precision-Recall (PR) We use the pr.curve() function from the PRROC package (Grau, Grosse, and Keilwagen 2015): # NOTE: PRROC considers by default that larger prediction values indicate the # positive class labeling.
